Status of implementation: Works (Passed all test cases provided by cs537 staff to students -- Score: 18)

This implementation includes initial sections which fetch the commandline arguments and look out for error cases.
Next the implementation opens the file and iterates through its lines and stores all fortunes into a dynamically allocated array,
whose size is determined by initial 2 lines of the fortune file. As the batch.txt can have numbers in any order, it is best
to store fortunes in an array and then print the indices of the array which are provided in the batch file or as number in -n mode.
